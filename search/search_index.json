It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students' own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention', that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/#tracks","title":"Tracks","text":"<p>The Master is structured around four conceptual dimensions: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application.</p> <p>These four tracks provide designers with the strategic vision and tools to work at multiple scales in the real world. The theoretical and practical content in the program recognises and explores the possibilities of disruptive technologies: digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence and others.</p> Instrumentation <p>Students learn a modular set of maker skills and tools and how these can be used in the design process to translate their ideas into prototypes and prototypes into products. Skills include coding, digital fabrication, hardware design, synthetic biology, and computational thinking.</p> Exploration <p>Students are exposed to a set of technologies and sociocultural phenomena that have the capacity to disrupt our present understanding of society, industry and the economy. Technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p> Reflection <p>Students are supported through individual and group reflection sessions to develop their own identity and skill set, knowledge and attitude as designers. A series of presentations and visits from key professionals helps make students aware about how their thinking, making, interests and values differ from others.</p> Application <p>Students create design responses to explore their curiosities through innovation. They are encouraged to be creative and follow a culture of making where prototyping acts as a generator of knowledge and experimentation is crucial for problem solving.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":"<p>Be supportive. </p> <p>Encourage and support your fellow students.

Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students. As mentioned before, the intention is to weave the two courses together in order to enhance both for the benefit of the students\u2019 projects.

The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t2/making-sense-and-meaning/#papers-to-read-and-video-to-watch","title":"Papers to read and video to watch","text":"<p>How Humanity Came To Rule The World | Yuval Noah Harari &amp; Neil deGrasse Tyson</p> <p>[Design as participation:]( (https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/design-as-participation/release/1)</p> <p>[A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things:]( (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319143816_A_History_of_the_World_in_Seven_Cheap_Things)</p> <p>[Steps to an Ecology of Mind:]( (https://ejcj.orfaleacenter.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1972.-Gregory-Bateson-Steps-to-an-Ecology-of-Mind.pdf)</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t2/making-sense-and-meaning/#course-completion-requirements","title":"Course completion requirements","text":""},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t2/making-sense-and-meaning/#breakdown","title":"Breakdown","text":"<p>Participation: 40% Attendance: 20% Essay: 40%</p> <ul> <li> <p>To read the provided articles and papers</p> </li> <li> <p>To attend at least 80% of the classes</p> </li> <li> <p>To write a blog entry of between 1500-2500 words at the end of the course on your website and design a vignette to illustrate the (some) following questions (feel free to replace them by more meaningful ones to you):</p> <ol> <li> <p>How design can reconfigure systems of extraction?</p> </li> <li> <p>Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools?</p> </li> <li> <p>How can we design the transition towards these worlds?</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>Suggestion: Feel free to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to write and illustrate the class assignment.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t2/making-sense-and-meaning/#late-assignments","title":"Late Assignments","text":"<p>Late work will be deducted 5% per twenty-four-hour period that elapses after the due date.

They are the drivers of the global economy, centres of creativity, diversity, and  interaction - and they are home to the majority of the global population. Cities cover only 3% of the earth\u2019s surface, yet they consume 75% of global natural resources, making them effective places to address critical environmental and social challenges. A large part of the environmental impact of cities can be attributed to the Built Environment. Roughly 40% of all carbon emissions are related to this part of our economy. 10% can be attributed to embodied carbon, where 30% can be attributed to energy consumption.</p> <p>Growing urban regions and consumption patterns combined with an extractive and wasteful economy create many adverse environmental impacts both inside and outside of our human habitats. Our linear economy is at the root of these challenges: core to this economic model is a fundamental disconnect between how we live our lives and do business, and what this means for the natural ecosystems that allow us to live happy, healthy sustainable lives.</p> <p>In 2004 it was estimated that at the current rate of mining, we are left with 32 years of copper, 23 years of tin, and 21 years of lead (C.O\u2019Donnell, D.Pranger).

This system map helps to identify root causes and leverage points for change on the basis of more intangible forces which steer our societies.

An example is the \u20187 Pillars of the Circular Economy\u2019 framework by Metabolic, used by companies and cities globally. It will be used as a holistic framework to assess trade-offs and understand the net positive impact of the design decisions and solutions.</p> <p>Secondly, students will map the materials and their respected embodied carbon coming in and out of a chosen case study. By analysing the process that construction materials go through, from the extraction of the raw materials, transportation, manufacturing, and assembling, to the end of life scenarios, and understanding the potential ways of shifting this linear thinking towards more circular approach, will highlight the global impact of the case studies in relation to the CO2 emissions and the environmental footprint.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>At course completion the student will:</p> <ul> <li>Be familiar with the principles of systems thinking and impact assessments to identify root causes and leverage points in achieving progress towards a sustainable change;</li> <li>Understand the basics of the circular economy as it relates to the urban context and the built environment, including potential applications and their limitations;</li> <li>Be able to map the material flows and their embodied carbon through the lifecycle;</li> <li>Be familiar of the environmental impact caused by analysed materials and how to design for reducing it;</li> <li>Be able to bring these tools into practice and assess how the individual master thesis project addresses the issues that need to be solved, identify systemic barriers to implementation and propose solutions that can help overcome them.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#grading-method","title":"Grading Method","text":"<p>European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)</p> <p>3 ECTS</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#additional-resources","title":"Additional Resources","text":"<ul> <li>McDonough, W. and Braungart, M.

Some small changes might include updating a faculty bio, changing a photo, or fixing a detail on a module page. However, larger changes are a bit more complex and should be done in a more systematic way, which will be covered in detail below.</p> <p>This document will first look at some basics (Markdown guidelines, <code>git</code> development workflows, and local development). This foundational knowledge will allow us to move onto the specifics of major changes to this website.</p> <p>After laying the groundwork, the bulk of this guide will consider three major changes that might need to be made to the MDEF website and specific guidelines on how to make these changes:</p> <ol> <li>Adding new module pages</li> <li>Adding a new faculty profile</li> <li>Updating the menu to reflect these changes</li> </ol> <p>First though, we need to start with the basics before we can start editing.

Some are native to MkDocs and others have been created based on the needs of the MDEF website. The Front Matter of the page goes at the very top of a Markdown document. Here are the keys used in MDEF module pages followed by a description of each of them and then an example filled out correctly.</p> Front Matter for module pages<pre><code>---\ntitle:\npage_type:\ntrack:\ncourse_type:\nfeature_img:\nimg_caption:\nfaculty:\n    - \nects:\n---\n</code></pre> <p>Understanding the Front Matter keys used on module pages</p> <p>Keys in Front Matter are the different fields that need to be filled in, for example: <code>title:</code>, <code>page_type:</code> or <code>faculty:</code></p> <p>title: This is your H1, the title of the course in the case of the MDEF modules. This title will appear on top of your banner image. It should not be excessively long.</p> <p>page_type: For MDEF modules this will always be <code>course</code>, written in lowercase.</p> <p>track: Track types include: <code>Application</code>, <code>Reflection</code>, <code>Exploration</code>, and <code>Instrumentation</code>. When written in the Front Matter, make sure the track names are written correctly and with the first letter capitalized. If this is not done correctly, the corresponding icon will not appear properly in your intro banner and the course will not be included in module lists, like this one.</p> <p>course_type: The course types are less rigid in their formatting than the tracks. They will appear at the top of the banner image next to the track type written just as they are input into this field (respecting capitalization, etc.). The original course types agreed upon are: workshop, seminar, short course, and long course, with only one course type being selected under ideal conditions. These should be written with the first letter capitalized to respect formatting guidelines, but on a technical level not doing so will not produce an error.</p> <p>feature_img: The featured image will appear as the banner image on a module page. The image will automatically be cropped to a 16/9 aspect ratio cropping evenly, thus prioritizing the center of the image and standardizing the sizes of the images without additional work. Likewise, the image has a color overlay for stylistic purposes, this cannot be changed. To define a featured image, you need to define a relative path as described in the image section of this guide.</p> <p>Saving images</p> <p>All images should be saved in the <code>assets</code> folder under <code>images</code> to maintain order. For module courses, these images are saved in the corresponding year, and then term. An example of the location of featured image can be seen below in the example of Front Matter with the content filled out. Image files should be reduced to be less than 1000KB (1MB) to ensure fast loading of the page. The naming convention for these images is the name of the course in lowercase with dashes between words.</p> <p>img_caption: The image caption will be added just as it is written below the module banner image. If this is left blank or simply not included, no caption will appear.</p> <p>faculty: Since there can be multiple faculty on a single module, this <code>key</code> allows for a list of <code>values</code>, so it has a slightly different format. In this case, even if there is a single faculty member to list, a line break is needed, followed by a tab, dash (-), a space, and then the faculty name. The format of the faculty name should be firstname-lastname. (See the example below). Naming conventions correspond to the faculty files, so these should match exactly. This will be covered later in the section on adding a new faculty member.</p> <p>ects: This is the amount of credits that this course is accredited for.</p> <p>Troubleshooting Front Matter on module pages</p> <ol> <li>Front Matter must start and end with three dashes (---) on their own lines.</li> <li>Following each <code>key</code>, there must be a colon (:) followed by a space. If you do not include this space, it will produce an error.</li> <li>Some <code>keys</code> can have multiple <code>values</code>, like in the case of faculty. <code>Keys</code> like this have a slightly different formatting.
